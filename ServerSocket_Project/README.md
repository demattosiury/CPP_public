# About this project
## Introduction
This project serves as the foundation for a private data analysis project. It is designed to be built as a `.dll` and implemented in an Expert Advisor (MT5), creating a server using a WebSocket connection.

## How it works
After building the `.dll` with a compiler, copy and paste it into the same folder as your Expert Advisor. Import the `.dll` in your code and use its functions to create your server.
